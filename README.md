## Palindrome

**https://palindromes-app.netlify.app/**

### This is a React-based application that allows users to check if a text entered by the user is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces and punctuation marks.

## **Features**
`Palindrome Check:` Allows the user to input text and check if it's a palindrome.
`Interactive Interface:` Uses SweetAlert2 to display alert messages for success or failure.
`Input Cleanup:` Removes non-alphanumeric characters and converts the text to uppercase before checking.
`Multilingual Support:` Messages are displayed in both English and Spanish.

## **Usage**
Type a text into the input field.
Click the "Check" button to check if the text is a palindrome.
If the text is a palindrome, a success alert will appear.
If the text is not a palindrome, an error alert will appear.
You can clear the input field and result by clicking the "Clear" button.

## **Technologies Used**
React: Main library for building the user interface.
SweetAlert2: Library for displaying interactive alerts.
